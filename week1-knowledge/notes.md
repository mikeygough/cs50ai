__Knowledge-Based-Agents__ : Agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge.

__Sentence__ : An assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language.

Let's begin with __Propositional Logic__.

Propositional Symbols: P, Q, R. Each symbol can represent a certain sentence or fact about the world.

But we don't just want random statements floating around, we want connections between them. These are known as __Logical Connectives__.

Not, And, Or, Implication, Biconditional are five of the most important.

__Model__ : Assignment of a truth value to every propositional symbol (a "possible world").

__Knowledge Base__ : A set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent.
